AbstractController::ActionNotFound - The action 'index' could not be found for UsersController:

Started GET "/users.html" for 127.0.0.1 at 2018-10-15 14:24:06 -0400
Processing by UsersController#index as HTML
Completed 406 Not Acceptable in 203ms (ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)



ActionController::UnknownFormat - UsersController#index is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.:
